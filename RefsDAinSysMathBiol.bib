	abstract = {Motivation: Many problems of interest in dynamic modeling and control of biological systems can be posed as non-linear optimization problems subject to algebraic and dynamic constraints. In the context of modeling, this is the case of e.g. parameter estimation, optimal experimental design and dynamic flux balance analysis. In the context of control, model-based metabolic engineering or drug dose optimization problems can be formulated as (multi-objective) optimal control problems. Finding a solution to those problems is a very challenging task which requires advanced numerical methods.Results: This work presents the AMIGO2 toolbox: the first multiplatform software tool that automatizes the solution of all those problems, offering a suite of state-of-the-art (multi-objective) global optimizers and advanced simulation approaches.Availability: The toolbox and its documentation are available at: sites.google.com/site/amigo2toolboxContact: ebalsa@iim.csic.es},

The author presents state estimation theory clearly and rigorously, providing the right amount of advanced material, recent research results, and references to enable the reader to apply state estimation techniques confidently across a variety of fields in science and engineering. While there are other textbooks that treat state estimation, this one offers special features and a unique perspective and pedagogical approach that speed learning: * Straightforward, bottom-up approach begins with basic concepts and then builds step by step to more advanced topics for a clear understanding of state estimation * Simple examples and problems that require only paper and pen to solve lead to an intuitive understanding of how theory works in practice * MATLAB(r)-based source code that corresponds to examples in the book, available on the author's Web site, enables readers to recreate results and experiment with other simulation setups and parameters Armed with a solid foundation in the basics, readers are presented with a careful treatment of advanced topics, including unscented filtering, high order nonlinear filtering, particle filtering, constrained state estimation, reduced order filtering, robust Kalman filtering, and mixed Kalman/H? filtering. Problems at the end of each chapter include both written exercises and computer exercises. Written exercises focus on improving the reader's understanding of theory and key concepts, whereas computer exercises help readers apply theory to problems similar to ones they are likely to encounter in industry. With its expert blend of theory and practice, coupled with its presentation of recent research results, Optimal State Estimation is strongly recommended for undergraduate and graduate-level courses in optimal control and state estimation theory. It also serves as a reference for engineers and science professionals across a wide array of industries."–Publisher's website.},

The processes are usually nonlinear, high dimensional, and time-resolved experimental data of the processes are sparse. Therefore, parameter estimation faces the challenges of structural and practical nonidentifiability. Nonidentifiability of parameters induces nonobservability of trajectories, reducing the predictive power of the model. We will discuss a generic approach for nonlinear models that allows for identifiability and observability analysis by means of a realistic example from systems biology. The results will be utilized to design new experiments that enhance model predictiveness, illustrating the iterative cycle between modeling and experimentation in systems biology.},

Often only parts of the model can be observed directly. Given a model that sufficiently describes the measured data, it is important to infer how well model parameters are determined by the amount and quality of experimental data. This knowledge is essential for further investigation of model predictions. For this reason a major topic in modeling is identifiability analysis.We suggest an approach that exploits the profile likelihood. It enables to detect structural non-identifiabilities, which manifest in functionally related model parameters. Furthermore, practical non-identifiabilities are detected, that might arise due to limited amount and quality of experimental data. Last but not least confidence intervals can be derived. The results are easy to interpret and can be used for experimental planning and for model reduction.An implementation is freely available for MATLAB and the PottersWheel modeling toolbox at http://web.me.com/andreas.raue/profile/software.html.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models provide abstract representations of the information gained from experimental observations on the structure and function of a particular biological system. Conferring a predictive character on a given mathematical formulation often relies on determining a number of non-measurable parameters that largely condition the model's response. These parameters can be identified by fitting the model to experimental data. However, this fit can only be accomplished when identifiability can be guaranteed.We propose a novel iterative identification procedure for detecting and dealing with the lack of identifiability. The procedure involves the following steps: 1) performing a structural identifiability analysis to detect identifiable parameters; 2) globally ranking the parameters to assist in the selection of the most relevant parameters; 3) calibrating the model using global optimization methods; 4) conducting a practical identifiability analysis consisting of two (a priori and a posteriori) phases aimed at evaluating the quality of given experimental designs and of the parameter estimates, respectively and 5) optimal experimental design so as to compute the scheme of experiments that maximizes the quality and quantity of information for fitting the model.The presented procedure was used to iteratively identify a mathematical model that describes the NF-kappaB regulatory module involving several unknown parameters. We demonstrated the lack of identifiability of the model under typical experimental conditions and computed optimal dynamic experiments that largely improved identifiability properties.},

	abstract = {Formulates long standing state and parameter estimation problems. Explores numerous examples drawn from a broad interdisciplinary collection of scholarly subjects. Proposes a universal approach with practical examples to bolster significant advances in solving the problems of model determination and parameter estimation. Predicting the Future: Completing Models of Observed Complex Systems provides a general framework for the discussion of model building and validation across a broad spectrum of disciplines. This is accomplished through the development of an exact path integral for use in transferring information from observations to a model of the observed system. Through many illustrative examples drawn from models in neuroscience, fluid dynamics, geosciences, and nonlinear electrical circuits, the concepts are exemplified in detail. Practical numerical methods for approximate evaluations of the path integral are explored, and their use in designing experiments and determining a model's consistency with observations is investigated. Using highly instructive examples, the problems of data assimilation and the means to treat them are clearly illustrated. This book will be useful for students and practitioners of physics, neuroscience, regulatory networks, meteorology and climate science, network dynamics, fluid dynamics, and other systematic investigations of complex systems –},

	shorttitle = {Data assimilation},
	abstract = {This book provides a systematic treatment of the mathematical underpinnings of work in data assimilation, covering both theoretical and computational approaches. Specifically the authors develop a unified mathematical framework in which a Bayesian formulation of the problem provides the bedrock for the derivation, development and analysis of algorithms; the many examples used in the text, together with the algorithms which are introduced and discussed, are all illustrated by the MATLAB software detailed in the book and made freely available online. The book is organized into nine chapters: the first contains a brief introduction to the mathematical tools around which the material is organized; the next four are concerned with discrete time dynamical systems and discrete time data; the last four are concerned with continuous time dynamical systems and continuous time data and are organized analogously to the corresponding discrete time chapters. This book is aimed at mathematical researchers interested in a systematic development of this interdisciplinary field, and at researchers from the geosciences, and a variety of other scientific fields, who use tools from data assimilation to combine data with time-dependent models. The numerous examples and illustrations make understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of data assimilation accessible. Furthermore, the examples, exercises and MATLAB software, make the book suitable for students in applied mathematics, either through a lecture course, or through self-study},
